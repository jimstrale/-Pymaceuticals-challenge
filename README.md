Observations and Insights

1. There was a proportionality equal amount of male and female mice used in this study. There were 249 total mice in this study. 50.2% were male (n = 125), 49.8% were female (n = 124).
2. Mouse ID, s185, showed a negative correlation in regards to the tumor size to the affects of Capomulin over the various timepoints during the study. The mouse started with a tumor size of around 45 mm3 at timepoint 0 and showed a decrease in tumor size to under 25 mm3 at timepoint 45.
3. A correlation value of 0.708 between average tumor volume (mm3) and average weight of the mice would indicate that a significant and positive relationship exists between the two variables.



I was unable to figure out how to complete the box and whisker using the loop. Instead I biuld separate series for each drug regimen and pulled them all in to the same plot.
